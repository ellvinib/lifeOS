# Pull Request Creation Instructions

## Current Status
âœ… All changes committed to branch: `feature/advertising-expense-model`
âœ… Commit message includes detailed changelog
âœ… 252 files changed, ~50,000 lines added

## Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Fastest)

### Step 1: Authenticate GitHub CLI
```bash
gh auth login
```
Follow the prompts to authenticate with your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
```bash
cd /Users/vincentbouillart/ai-git/lifeOS
gh repo create lifeOS --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

This will:
- Create a new GitHub repository called "lifeOS"
- Set it as the origin remote
- Push all branches including your feature branch

### Step 3: Create Pull Request
```bash
gh pr create --title "Add Advertising Expense Model with ROI Analytics" --body "$(cat <<'PRBODY'
## Summary
Implement complete advertising expense tracking system with comprehensive ROI analytics for the Finance module.

## Features
- ðŸ“Š Campaign management with lifecycle tracking (draft â†’ active â†’ paused â†’ completed)
- ðŸ’° Expense tracking with performance metrics (impressions, clicks, conversions, revenue)
- ðŸ“ˆ ROI calculations: ROI, ROAS, CTR, CVR, CPC, CPM, CPA, profit margin
- âœ… Business rule enforcement (date validation, metrics constraints)
- ðŸŽ¯ Event-driven architecture with domain events
- ðŸ“Š Aggregated analytics per campaign

## Technical Implementation
- **Domain Layer**: 2 rich entities, 2 value objects, 2 repository interfaces
- **Infrastructure Layer**: 2 Prisma repositories, 2 mappers
- **Application Layer**: 4 use cases (6-step pattern)
- **Presentation Layer**: 12 Zod validation schemas
- **Database**: 2 new Prisma models with indexes
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E tests (14 test cases)

## Architecture
- Clean Architecture (4 layers)
- SOLID principles applied
- Railway Oriented Programming (Result<T, E>)
- Rich domain models (no anemic model anti-pattern)
- Event sourcing ready

## Files Created
- **22 files** (~4,630 lines of production code)
- **252 total files** changed (includes existing Finance module code)

## Test Coverage
âœ… 14 E2E test cases covering:
- Complete CRUD lifecycle
- ROI calculation verification
- Business rule validation
- Error handling
- Campaign status transitions
- Metrics updates
- Filter and query operations

## Test plan
- [ ] Run Playwright E2E tests: `pnpm test:e2e`
- [ ] Generate Prisma client: `cd packages/api && pnpm prisma generate`
- [ ] Create database migration: `pnpm prisma migrate dev --name add-advertising-models`
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Review ROI calculations accuracy
- [ ] Test campaign lifecycle transitions
- [ ] Validate metrics constraints

## Breaking Changes
None - This is a new feature addition.

## Documentation
- `ADVERTISING_EXPENSE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed architecture
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Quick reference
- `tests/e2e/finance/advertising-campaign.spec.ts` - E2E test examples
